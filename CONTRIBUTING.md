# Contributing

Help us create relevant and useful content for developers like yourself. See something you'd like to add or change? We love pull requests!

## Before You Start

* If you don't have one already, sign up for a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free).
* Fork the pantheon-systems/documentation repository on GitHub.
  Trying to edit or create a file in this repository will create your fork automatically.
* [Clone your fork locally](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/).
* Add our repo as a remote. `git remote add upstream git@github.com:pantheon-systems/documentation.git`.

**NOTE**: All contributions must be licensed under [CC-BY-SA](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/). Code snippet contributions must additionally be licensed under [The MIT License](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT). You must have permission to contribute your work under these terms.

## Issues - Searching and Creating

Before you edit or create a doc, search [open issues](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/documentation/issues) to make sure you can't find anything related to what you want to work on. If there isn't an issue, create one and add an outline for the article you want to create. This allows contributors to get some initial feedback.

###Titles and Descriptions
When creating issues, add a clear title and description. Issues should contain relevant information e.g., the document title, the information that is incorrect or outdated and your suggestion on how to fix it, reasons why method A is better than method B, and so on.

**Example**:  
Title: Apache Solr doc - Terminus command is not working  
Description: The document currently suggests using XYZ commands, but I get the following error (insert error message). The fix is to use XYZ commands.

###Labels

Add labels to issues by clicking the gear in the sidebar on the right. Labels are used to signify priority, category, and to help filter existing issues. For example, if a doc is incorrect, the label 'Doc Defect' should be applied.

## Edit Existing Docs

1. Search [open issues](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/documentation/issues) to make sure your isn't duplicated.
2. Locally, cd to the `documentation` repository and use `git checkout -b <new-branch-name>` to switch to a new branch.
3. Edit locally, commit changes, and push to your fork.
4. Search the repo for links to the document you are editing, and edit those docs if your changes affect the changes made in the linking document.

## Keep your Local Updated with Master

From your local repo, run the following commands in order:  
1. `git checkout master`  
2. `git pull upstream master`  
3. `git push origin master` 

## Add a New Doc

### Front Matter
All of our documentation is generated from markdown files, found at [`source/docs/articles/`](/source/docs/articles/) and [`source/docs/guides/`](source/docs/guides/). These markdown files must have front matter that allow the page to render successfully. This is required if you plan to create a new doc. Here's an example:
```
---
title: Starting With Git
description: Use Git version control with your Pantheon site.
category:
  - getting-started
  - developing

---
```

### Attribution
If you're creating your **first** guide, you must also create an Author profile. Fill out the information below and add it to the [`sculpin_site.yml`](/app/config/sculpin_site.yml) file. Commit this change alongside your new guide.
```

```
Please provide at least "name" and "bio". The "gplus" URL is useful to show your author info on Google search results.
